A [Reactor](https://github.com/ash-project/reactor) extension that provides steps for working with HTTP requests via [Req](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req).

## Example

The following example uses Reactor to retrieve the repository description from the Forgejo API:

```elixir
defmodule GetForgejoRepoDescription do
  use Reactor, extensions: [Reactor.Req]

  input :hostname
  input :owner
  input :repo

  step :repo_url do
    argument :hostname, input(:hostname)
    argument :owner, input(:owner)
    argument :repo, input(:repo)

    run fn args ->
      URI.new("https://#{args.hostname}/api/v1/repos/#{args.owner}/#{args.repo}")
    end
  end

  req_get :get_repo do
    url result(:repo_url)
    headers value([accept: "application/json"])
    http_errors value(:raise)
  end

  step :get_description do
    argument :description, result(:get_repo, [:body, "description"])
    run fn args -> {:ok, args.description} end
  end
end

Reactor.run!(GetForgejoRepoDescription, %{
  hostname: "harton.dev",
  owner: "james",
  repo: "reactor_req"
})

# => "A Reactor DSL extension for making HTTP requests with Req."
```
